## Features

### Economy

Members gain XP by sending messages in the server. By collecting enough XP (AKA `score` or `points`), users level up over time.

Additionally, users can collect `credits` through activity, the `/econ daily` command, and various other means. These can be used in the shop to purchase certain roles and other server items.

### Moderation

The bot automatically detects offensive language and notifies the staff to ensure the server harbors a safe and inclusive environment.

### Welcome

When a user joins, they are greeted with a list of helpful channels to check out, as well as a button that signs them up for the `@announcements` role.
